    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The soufflé omelette is the easiest way to practice making any kind of soufflé, given the low barrier to entry. If you have some eggs and a few extra minutes to beat the whites, you can do it. No need to prep a soufflé dish or preheat an oven, and no need to make a béchamel or pastry cream base, nor bake it until puffed and browned.</p>
    <p>Even better, once you've successfully made a soufflé omelette—which you will do on the first try, because it is easy—you will then be free of any lingering doubt you might have had about whether you are capable of making a classic soufflé, since the challenge of one is the challenge of the other, and it isn't much of a challenge at all.</p>
    <p>But while the soufflé omelette can be a confidence-booster for making classic soufflés, it's also a valid dish all on its own, delicious as a light breakfast, lunch, or dinner.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>3 large eggs, separated</li>
        <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 ounces (55g) grated Gruyère or cheddar cheese, divided</li>
        <li>Minced fresh chives (optional)</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon (15g) unsalted butter</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In medium bowl, beat egg yolks with a generous pinch of salt and some freshly ground black pepper until well mixed.</li>
        <li>In separate large mixing bowl, using a whisk, electric hand blender, or stand mixer fitted with whisk attachment, beat egg whites until firm, glossy peaks form.</li>
        <li>Add half of the beaten egg whites to yolks and stir well until whites are thoroughly combined and soufflé base has a looser consistency. Mix in half the cheese as well as the chives, if using. Add remaining beaten whites, and, using a silicone spatula, gently fold them into the soufflé base just until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a 9- or 10-inch nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat until foaming. Scrape soufflé base into pan. Using spatula, spread soufflé base into even circle and smooth out the surface. Cover and cook until bottom of omelette is browned and top is just barely set (or even a little loose still, if you prefer). Scatter remaining cheese on top; cover once more and cook until cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute longer.</li>
        <li>Carefully slide the omelette out of the pan and onto a warm serving plate, folding it over itself. Serve right away.</li>
