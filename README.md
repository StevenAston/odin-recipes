# odin-recipes

A small first assignment for the Odin project. HTML is obviously not new to me but I learned several new tools like vscode etc and by this point I've learned a lot about virtual machines etc to get to this point.

I'm tempted to keep fiddling with this and make it really nice but it's way out of scope and what I have works so I'll settle for the header on the index page being the flourish.
